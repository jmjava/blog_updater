## Topic and outline for this post

*(For Cursor only — you prompt Cursor to read this and write the Content below. The script does not send this to the API; it only sends title + Content + Images.)*

Describe what *this* blog entry is about: your outline, tone, audience, and key points. Cursor will use this to generate the post body.

Example:
- Audience: developers interested in tooling
- Tone: friendly, concise
- Key points: 1) Problem X, 2) How we solved it, 3) What to try next
- Include a short intro and a clear conclusion

## Images

Add image paths and optional captions (one per line). Format: `path` or `path - Caption`

**Local images** (relative to this file) are uploaded to Google Drive automatically:
- my-diagram.png - Workflow diagram

**URLs** work too:
- https://example.com/photo.jpg - Main photo

## Content

(Leave empty. Ask Cursor to generate the post body from the topic/outline and images above, and put the HTML here.)
